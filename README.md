# SGC++

A remake of SigmaGreg.

## ToDo List:
- Variables
- Functions
- If statements
- While loops
- For loops
- Input
- Output
- Comments
- Error handling
- Every fucking thing

## Syntax that I want to implement:

```
var name = gReadln("What's your name? ")
    
if (name == "Greg") then
    gPrintln("greg..")
else
    gPrintln(a"Hello @name")
end if
```

# Why will this be better?

  **First of all:**

  - SigmaGreg is ass and needs to be fixed
  - Everything in the old SigmaGreg just has greg in it. I want to make it so it's more easier to learn
  - Will bring REAL if statements, functions and more!
  - More unique

# What does the new Syntax keywords mean???

### gPrintln()
  > gPrintln() is how you would print, just like `gregPr`.
### gReadln()
  > gReadln() is how you take input. It's the exact same as `gregIn`

# Why should I be happy about this?

  **I don't fucking know, all I know is that I'm gonna make it have more features and be more better.**
