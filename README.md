# SGC++

A remake of SigmaGreg.

## To-Do List:

- [x] Variables
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] If statements
- [ ] While loops
- [ ] For loops
- [x] Input
- [x] Output
- [x] Comments
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Every fucking thing

## Better Syntax
**Just look at this!!!**

```
var name = gReadln("What is your name? ")
var change_name = name.lower() // change the variable to lowercase
gPrintln(f"Hai {change_name}! I hope you're having a good day :3")

// random ass math
gPrintln(2 + 2)

```

---


# Why is this better?

  **First of all:**

  - SigmaGreg had ass syntax, you could barely do anything and there were so many things that was bad about it. SGC++ will fix all of that.
  - Nicer looking keywords (eg: ```gPrintln()```) unlike the original SigmaGreg Code (eg: ```gregPr```)
  - Not as buggy!!!

---

# What does the new Syntax keywords mean???

### gPrintln()
  > gPrintln() is how you would print, just like `gregPr`.
### gReadln()
  > gReadln() is how you take input. It's the exact same as `gregIn`
