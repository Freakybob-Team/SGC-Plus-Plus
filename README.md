# SGC++

A remake of SigmaGreg.

## To-Do List:

- [x] Variables
- [ ] Functions
- [x] If statements **(kinda done)**
- [x] While loops **(new, needs to be fixed)**
- [x] For loops   **(new, needs to be fixed)**
- [x] Input
- [x] Output
- [x] Comments
- [x] Error handling **(kinda done)**
- [ ] Move to-do items to individual GitHub issues <!-- grrr -->
- [x] Python modules **(kinda done)**
- [x] Lists 
- [ ] Every freaking thing


## Better Syntax
**Just look at this!!!**

```
import random

// variables
var abc = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
var digits = "0123456789"
var special_chars = "!@#$%^&*()_-+=<>?"
var all_chars = abc + abc.upper() + digits + special_chars

let password = ""
let length = 12
let i = 0

// brand new WHILE LOOP!!!!!!
while (i < length) do
    password = password + random.choice(all_chars)
    i = i + 1
end

// Final password
gPrintln(f"Generated password: {password}")
```

**WAY better than SigmaGreg's syntax..**

```
credit_number:
ssn:
credit_num_back:

gregPr "I need your credit card number to make sure you not hacked\n"
gregIn credit_number
gregPr "Thank you, now I need your social security to make sure to identity fraud\n"
gregIn ssn
gregPr "thank you, now I need 3 number on back to make sure your bank account safe\n"
gregIn credit_num_back

gregPr f"Ok so I have {credit_number}, {ssn}, and {credit_num_back}\n"
gregPr "ghahahaha you have been hacked hahgahgahah" 
```

# Why is this better?

  **First of all:**

  - SigmaGreg had bad syntax, you could barely do anything and there were so many things that was bad about it. SGC++ will fix all of that.
  - Nicer looking keywords (eg: ```gPrintln()```) unlike the original SigmaGreg Code (eg: ```gregPr```)
  - Not as buggy!!!

---

# What does the new Syntax keywords mean???

### gPrintln()
  > gPrintln() is how you would print, just like `gregPr`.
### gReadln()
  > gReadln() is how you take input. It's the exact same as `gregIn`
