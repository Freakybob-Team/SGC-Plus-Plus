# SGC++

A remake of SigmaGreg.

## To-Do List:

- [x] Variables
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] If statements
- [ ] While loops
- [ ] For loops
- [x] Input
- [x] Output
- [x] Comments
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Move to-do items to individual GitHub issues <!-- grrr -->
- [ ] Every fucking thing

## Better Syntax
**Just look at this!!!**

```
// hahaha get hacked loser
gPrintln("I need your credit card number to make sure you not hacked\n")
var credit_number = gReadln(">> ")

gPrintln("Thank you, now I need your social security to make sure to identity fraud\n")
var ssn = gReadln(">> ")

gPrintln("thank you, now I need 3 number on back to make sure your bank account safe\n")
var credit_num_back = gReadln(">> ")

gPrintln(f"Ok so I have {credit_number}, {ssn}, and {credit_num_back}\n")

gPrintln("ghahahaha you have been hacked hahgahgahah")
```

**WAY better than SigmaGreg's syntax..**

```
credit_number:
ssn:
credit_num_back:

gregPr "I need your credit card number to make sure you not hacked\n"
gregIn credit_number
gregPr "Thank you, now I need your social security to make sure to identity fraud\n"
gregIn ssn
gregPr "thank you, now I need 3 number on back to make sure your bank account safe\n"
gregIn credit_num_back

gregPr f"Ok so I have {credit_number}, {ssn}, and {credit_num_back}\n"
gregPr "ghahahaha you have been hacked hahgahgahah" 
```

# Why is this better?

  **First of all:**

  - SigmaGreg had ass syntax, you could barely do anything and there were so many things that was bad about it. SGC++ will fix all of that.
  - Nicer looking keywords (eg: ```gPrintln()```) unlike the original SigmaGreg Code (eg: ```gregPr```)
  - Not as buggy!!!

---

# What does the new Syntax keywords mean???

### gPrintln()
  > gPrintln() is how you would print, just like `gregPr`.
### gReadln()
  > gReadln() is how you take input. It's the exact same as `gregIn`
